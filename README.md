# Yahtzee Scoreboard React Application
Small React Native app using expo for keeping up score on a yahtzee game.
Code publicly available for anyone curious and ready for horrors.

## Info
I made this app for my family's cottage trips and bar nights where we want to play Yahtzee without having to use a pen to write down the scores.
The scoring system most likely differs a lot from scoreboard to scoreboard but this one was made using the one I am familiar with.

## Requirements
If you want to run this project for any reason, you will need Node and Expo.

## Releases
Haven't done any yet.
