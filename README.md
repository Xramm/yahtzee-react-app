# Yahtzee Scoreboard React Application
Small React Native app using expo for keeping up score on a Yahtzee game.

Code publicly available for anyone curious and ready for horrors.

## Info
I made this app for my family's cottage trips and bar nights where we wanted to play Yahtzee without having to use a pen to write down the scores.

The scoring system most likely differs a lot from scoreboard to scoreboard but this one was made using the one I am familiar with.

## Requirements
If you want to run this project for any reason, you will need Node and Expo.

## Running the App
Latest APK can be found in the releases.
